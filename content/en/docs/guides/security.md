## Reporting New Security Problems with Apache HugeGraph
The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks against its products.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to an undisclosed security problem in our source code will be ignored.


The private security mailing address is: security@xxx.org

An overview of the vulnerability handling process is:

- The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to Apache.
- The appropriate project's security team works privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
- The project creates a new release of the package the vulnerabilty affects to deliver its fix.
- The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how to apply the fix.
